<h1><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>What is Python?</strong></span></h1>
<p>Python is one of the most popular programming languages, which was created and released by Guido Van Rossum in 1991.</p>
<p>List, garbage collection system, comprehensions are some of the features that were introduced with Python2 in 2000.</p>
<p>Python 3 was introduced in 2008. It was a major revision of the Python language which is not backward compatible. Basically, the codes work on Python3 cannot be used on Python2 and&nbsp;vice versa.</p>
<p>In this course all the presented lines of codes are compatible with Python3.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Python is widely used for:</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Software development</li>
<li>System scripting</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Data science</li>
<li>Web development</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Why to choose Python:</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Readability:</strong> Python uses English Language syntax.</li>
<li><strong>Portability:</strong> Python is available for many platforms (Linux, Pi, Windows, Mac, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Python programs require fewer lines of code.</li>
<li><strong>Usability:</strong> Python codes can be executed in several ways (Object oriented, Functional, Procedural).</li>
<li><strong>Speedy:</strong> Python can be executed as soon as its written-on interpreter systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Don't worry if some of these words appear strange,</p>
<p>we will explore all of these and much more together in this course.</p>
